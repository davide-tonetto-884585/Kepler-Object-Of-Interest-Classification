# Data description - Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs)
KOIs are well vetted, periodic, transit-like events in the Kepler data. The Kepler Project identifies these objects from the TCE list for further vetting. Some objects will be flagged as false positives.

All KOI tables are displayed in a single, interactive environment with separate tabs for each table (e.g., Q1-6, Q1-8, cumulative, etc). Column selection and filtering applies to all tabs, allowing easier comparison of values across KOI tables.

## Dataset Selection and Characteristics
The dataset selected for this statistical analysis aimed at predicting exoplanet status is the Q1-Q17 Data Release 25 (DR 25) Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) table. This specific table was chosen due to several key characteristics that make it particularly well-suited for developing robust statistical models:

1. **Uniform Data Processing**: The table is derived from Data Release 25, which represents the final, uniform processing of the entire primary Kepler mission dataset (Quarters 1 through 17). This ensures consistency in the underlying light curve data used for analysis.
2. **Automated and Uniform Vetting**: A critical feature of the DR 25 KOI table is its use of a fully automated dispositioning process, known as the Kepler Robovetter. This algorithm applies a consistent set of rules and metrics to uniformly classify each Threshold Crossing Event (TCE) as either a Planetary Candidate (PC) or a False Positive (FP).
3. **Designed for Statistical Analysis**: As explicitly stated in its documentation, this catalog was generated with the primary goal of enabling statistical analyses, such as the calculation of exoplanetary occurrence rates. The emphasis was placed on uniformity and automated, repeatable classification rather than maximizing the accuracy for every single individual object (which might involve manual intervention or external data, as seen in the DR25 Supplemental table).
4. **Homogeneity**: The automated and uniform vetting process yields a homogenous catalog suitable for robust statistical analyses. This internal consistency is crucial for training reliable statistical or machine learning models, as the classification criteria are applied consistently across all entries designated as KOIs within this table.

Therefore, the Q1-Q17 DR 25 KOI table was selected because its **rigorous, automated, and uniform classification methodology provides the most suitable foundation for building a statistical model** intended to predict whether an object is likely an exoplanet based on the parameters derived consistently from the Kepler pipeline and vetting process. This minimizes biases that could arise from aggregating data processed or vetted using different methods over time, as found in the Cumulative table, or from incorporating non-uniform manual assessments, as in the Supplemental table.

### Pixel-Based KOI Vetting Statistics
Two pixel analysis methods, flux-weighted centroid and PRF-fit difference images, are used to identify eclipsing binaries causing planetary transit false positives.

# Initial Analysis and Data Exploration
## Load data from .csv
```{r}
koi_data <- read.csv("data/q1_q17_dr25_koi.csv", comment.char = "#", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(koi_data)
```

## Initial summary
Let's start by looking at the summary statistics of the data.
```{r}
print(dfSummary(koi_data), method = "render")
```

## Response variable: koi_pdisposition 
Let's look at the two disposition variables and see how they compare.
`koi_disposition` indicate the category of this KOI from the Exoplanet Archive. Current values are CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED. All KOIs marked as CONFIRMED are also listed in the Exoplanet Archive Confirmed Planet table. Designations of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, and NOT DISPOSITIONED are taken from the Disposition Using Kepler Data.
Let's see how many of each disposition there are.
```{r}
# Using Exoplanet Archive disposition
koi_data %>% count(koi_disposition, sort = TRUE)
```

`koi_pdisposition` flag indicates the most probable explanation for a KOI, with values including FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE. False positives can result from eclipsing binary stars, background contamination, stellar variability, or instrumental artifacts.
Let's see how many of each probable disposition there are.
```{r}
# Using Kepler-only disposition
koi_data %>% count(koi_pdisposition, sort = TRUE)
```

Now compare the two dispositions to see if they match.
```{r}
# Compare the two dispositions
koi_data %>% count(koi_disposition, koi_pdisposition)
```

As we can see we have a few cases in which the two dispositions do not match. Specifically, we have a few cases where the disposition is CANDIDATE but the pdisposition is FALSE POSITIVE. Also, there are a few cases where the disposition is CONFIRMED but the pdisposition is FALSE POSITIVE. This is because the pdisposition is based on the Kepler-only pipeline, while the disposition is based on the Exoplanet Archive. Since those cases are rare, we can ignore them in our analysis by removing them from the data.

```{r}
# Remove only the cases where FALSE POSITIVE doesn't match between dispositions
koi_data <- koi_data %>%
  filter(!(koi_disposition == "CONFIRMED" & koi_pdisposition == "FALSE POSITIVE") &
    !(koi_disposition == "FALSE POSITIVE" & koi_pdisposition == "CANDIDATE"))
```

For the analysis, we will use the `koi_pdisposition` variable as the response variable since it is more accurate and consistent for statistical analysis.

## Factor variables
Let's transform the factor variables into factors and create a corresponding variable in range 0-1.
```{r}
factor_columns <- c(
  "koi_disposition", "koi_pdisposition",
  "koi_fpflag_nt", "koi_fpflag_ss", "koi_fpflag_co", "koi_fpflag_ec",
  "koi_fittype", "koi_sparprov", "koi_comment"
)

# Check which of these columns actually exist in our dataframe
factor_columns_exist <- factor_columns[factor_columns %in% names(koi_data)]

# Use mutate() and across() to apply as.factor() to the existing columns
# 'all_of()' is used to ensure it only tries to convert columns present
# in the 'factor_columns_exist' vector.
koi_data <- koi_data %>%
  mutate(across(all_of(factor_columns_exist), as.factor))

# Verify the conversion
print("Verifying column types after dplyr conversion:")
str(koi_data[, factor_columns_exist, drop = FALSE]) # Show structure of converted columns
```

## Null values analysis
Let's look at the number of NAs per column. We will only show the columns with more than 80% NAs.
```{r}
# Count NAs per column and show those with more than 80% NAs
na_counts <- data.frame(
  Column = names(koi_data),
  NAs = colSums(is.na(koi_data))
) %>%
  filter(NAs > 0.8 * nrow(koi_data)) %>%
  arrange(desc(NAs))

knitr::kable(na_counts)
```

We can remove those columns with more than 80% NAs since they are not useful for our analysis.
```{r}
# Remove columns with more than 80% NAs
koi_data <- koi_data %>% select(-all_of(na_counts$Column))
```

## Missingness visualization
Show missingness visualization only for columns with more than 2% of NAs.
```{r}
vis_miss(
  koi_data %>%
    select_if(~ (sum(is.na(.)) > 0.02 * nrow(koi_data))),
  warn_large_data = FALSE
)
```

## Final summary
```{r}
print(dfSummary(koi_data), method = "render")
```

## Save data
Save Rda data of the data exploration to the data folder.
```{r}
saveRDS(koi_data, "data/Rdas/koi_data.Rda")
```
